## The motivation and achedule
The project was program by me as a '10 days task' during a fullstack programing bootcamp. 
I did not perform any major changes(only some minor css changes) in the project since i end the 10 days. 
The project is not perfect and ready - its for learning porpuse. 
It was an adventure and great experience to deal with this challenge. 


## What i used for building the app?
- node.JS - Server side <br>
- vue.JS with vuex state management and Vite dev environment.  - Client side <br>
- MongoDB Atlas Database - database.
- Render - deploy and host for the site. 
- Socket.IO package - for real time changes.
